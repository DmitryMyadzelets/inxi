The command "echo /etc/*_ver* /etc/*-rel*; cat /etc/*_ver* /etc/*-rel*" should find any reasonably similar variants.

The /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files are also often helpful.

Linux System Base-compliant systems should have a file called /etc/lsb_release, which may be in addition to a distribution-specific file.

Many non-Red Hat RPM-based distributions include /etc/redhat-release for compatibility.
